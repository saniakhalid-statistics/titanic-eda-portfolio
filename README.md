# Titanic EDA Portfolio Project

**Author:** Sania Khalid  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using a simulated Titanic dataset.  
It highlights how survival outcomes relate to variables like gender, class, age, and fare.  
The goal is to showcase statistical thinking and data visualization skills in Python.

## Key Analyses & Visualizations

- ðŸ”¹ **Survival Count:** Understand the overall survival rate.
- ðŸ”¹ **Survival by Class:** See how ticket class influenced survival.
- ðŸ”¹ **Survival by Gender:** Observe clear survival differences between males and females.
- ðŸ”¹ **Age Distribution:** Analyze passenger age demographics.
- ðŸ”¹ **Correlation Heatmap:** Identify relationships between numerical features.

## Files Included

- `Sania_Khalid_Titanic_EDA_Code.py`: The Python script used to perform all analysis and visualizations.
- `Sania_Khalid_Titanic_EDA_Portfolio.pdf`: A professional report with visual results and interpretations.

## Insights

- First-class passengers and females had higher survival rates.
- Higher ticket fares slightly increased the chance of survival.
- Most passengers were between 20â€“40 years old.
